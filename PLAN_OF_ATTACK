- create a script that:
  - parses a JS file to an etree
  - traverses it, allowing only primitives and const name binding
  - prints the resulting JS
    (you can view this or pipe it to node)


... put it in a "notebook"-like UI
    ... avoid rerunning statements whose deps didn't change:
      - maintain "cells"
      - compute the reads and defs+writes of each cell using escope
      - put markers into the editor, telling you which cell it is
      - invalidating a cell invalidates any cell that depended on it
        - but rerunning is separate from invalidation
    ... try to avoid reparsing problems:
      - unmatched open paren: if reparsing the whole file fails,
        try parsing each cell?
        try parsing tails of the file?
      - or use "tolerant mode" of esprima?



repeat:
  - pick a puzzle
  - create a restricted-JS file that solves it
  - add whitelisting until it works



... represent imperative "Actions" as a value
    ... integrate with Promises?
        - use "await" syntax?
        - make every Action be / turn-into a Promise?

... support object spread
    - esprima does not
      - use another parsing lib?
      - transpile?
    - could support restricted use of Object.assign
